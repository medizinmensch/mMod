# 3D Configurator Web-App

## What is this?

mMod is a Tool to prepare and edit a 3D-Model in the Browser.

The `Inventor Addin` helps you marking parameters in an Inventor model and then export it as a jsCad-File.

Then, this File can be added to this [Folder](Web-App/src/scripts/jscad_scripts). The `Web-App` will include your model in the Select-Dropdown menu.

For further information see the seperate folders.

## Git clone the project

## Git branches

Then switch to your branch in console:

`Git checkout myBranch ` (switch to different branch)

## How we collaborate

1. clone (dont fork) your local copy
2. make your branch (by `git branch myBranch`)
3. set your branch as active (by `git checkout myBranch`)
4. set your upstream (by `it branch --set-upstream-to=origin/myBranch myBranch`)
